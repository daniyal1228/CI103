Learn and use React to create a website for better-organized coding storage. First, make sure "git command" and "node.js" are installed on the local machine, then download an integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code, to complete the process. Open Visual Studio Code, enter the project directory and edit the Home.jsx (jsx is HTML in react). Then, open the Command-line interface (CLI) built-in IDE and cd into the project directory. Use the command "npm run dev" in the CLI to show the localhost links and test in the local browser.
